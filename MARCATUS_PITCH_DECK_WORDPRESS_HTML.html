<pre><code>MARCATUS PITCH DECK
===================

TITLE & MISSION
---------------

Headline: Marcatus — The Neutral Exchange Layer for Real-World Assets

Mission: Connect every verified real-world asset to global liquidity. 
Any KYC/AML-cleared participant can discover, compare, and swap assets 
across chains in real time. No lock-ins. No walled gardens.


WHY NOW
-------

• On-chain RWAs are inflecting: tokenized treasuries, real estate, 
  invoices, music/IP, energy credits, fund shares, collectibles

• Fragmentation is the blocker: multiple chains (ETH, Base, Solana, 
  Polygon, Avalanche, BSC, L2s), multiple standards (ERC-20/721/1155/3643, 
  SPL, etc.), siloed marketplaces

• Institutions demand compliance-aware rails: KYC/AML, allowlists, 
  transfer restrictions, proof-of-ownership, disclosures

• Winners will be neutral routers that unify discovery, compliance 
  signals, and settlement—not walled gardens


THE PROBLEM
-----------

• RWA issuers rebuild the same plumbing: discovery, investor onboarding, 
  compliance checks, secondary liquidity, cross-chain UX

• Buyers can't find inventory or trust metadata; disclosures are 
  scattered; contracts vary widely

• Marketplaces are chain-siloed; liquidity is thin and fractured

• Compliance is bolted on after the fact; transfers break rules or 
  block legitimate transfers


THE SOLUTION: MARCATUS EXCHANGE LAYER
-------------------------------------

Unified Discovery & Indexing
• Crawler ingests RWA projects across public chains, permissioned 
  ledgers, custodial platforms
• Normalizes metadata, disclosures, provenance
• Surfaces docs, images, on-chain data

Compliance-Aware Trading
• Respects token rules (allowlists, transfer restrictions, jurisdictions)
• KYC/AML-cleared user flows
• Rule evaluation before execution

Cross-Chain Liquidity Routing
• Abstracts bridges/DEXs
• Orchestrates swaps where liquidity and compliance overlap

Offer/Exchange Engine
• Bilateral swaps and bids across any supported RWA standard
• Automated exchange proposals based on user preferences

Developer-First APIs
• Open, documented endpoints for issuers, brokers, wallets
• Webhooks, SDKs, integration playbooks


WHAT WE SOLVE
-------------

For Issuers:
• Instant distribution to multi-chain audience
• Standardized listings & disclosures
• Liquidity access without rebuilding marketplace infra
• Built-in compliance signals and transfer checks

For Investors/Traders:
• Single interface to browse, compare, trade RWAs across chains
• Verifiable metadata & documents
• Alerts, watchlists, automated exchange proposals
• Transparent fees, predictable settlement


COVERAGE DEPTH: PERMISSIONED & CUSTODIAL
----------------------------------------

How We Integrate Without Breaking Compliance:

• Adapter Library: Connectors for permissioned ledgers (Hyperledger, 
  Corda, bank-hosted networks) via compliance-approved APIs or 
  read-only nodes

• Custodial Integrations: SOC2-compliant data bridges with legal 
  agreements; we ingest state changes without taking custody

• Onboarding Speed: 4-week average integration (schema mapping, 
  compliance review, attestation exchange)

• Self-Service Playbooks: Partners can self-onboard with our support


DATA INTEGRITY & TRUST
----------------------

Normalization Pipeline:
• Structured schema with provenance tagging
• Checksum verification, document hash comparisons (IPFS/Arweave)

Verification:
• Multi-source reconciliation (on-chain events, issuer attestations, 
  custodian feeds)
• Confidence scores exposed to users

Event Reconciliation:
• Time-series ledger per asset with audit trails
• Anomalies trigger AI-assisted review and manual escalation

Compliance Graph:
• Maps token-level rules to user eligibility
• Updated via automated rule ingestion plus issuer sign-off


SWAP SETTLEMENT ASSURANCE
-------------------------

Atomicity Engine:
• Prefers native atomic swap mechanisms where available 
  (HTLC variants, cross-chain messaging)

Risk-Managed Fallback:
• Escrow smart contracts with time-locked exits
• Third-party custody or insurance options for incompatible consensus

Bridge Policy:
• Curated list of audited connectors
• On-chain proofs and SLAs
• Failed settlements auto-rollback with full traceable logs


GOVERNANCE & LEGAL NEUTRALITY
-----------------------------

Neutral Venue:
• Marcatus never custodies assets
• Coordinates compliant execution between user-controlled wallets 
  and regulated custodians

Jurisdiction Handling:
• Per-asset rule profiles (transfer restrictions, eligible investors) 
  enforced at execution
• Pluggable KYC/AML providers mapped per region

Regulatory Ops:
• Dedicated legal/compliance team
• Modular policy engine updated with jurisdictional changes

Future Governance:
• Open architecture moving toward DAO-led standards ratification
• Compliance guardrails remain under regulated entity oversight


PRODUCT STATUS (LIVE MODULES)
-----------------------------

✓ RWA Crawler & Indexer (multi-chain, permissioned connectors in pilot)
✓ Asset Pages with docs, disclosures, provenance pointers
✓ Search/Filters with compliance flags, chain, issuer, category
✓ Offers & Exchange Engine with bilateral proposals
✓ User Profiles with KYC status, notification settings
✓ REST API, developer docs, webhooks
✓ Web app + PWA parity, push notifications, background refresh


ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
--------------------

Data Plane:
• Multi-chain listeners, permissioned ledger adapters, custodial feeds
• IPFS/Arweave fetchers, compliance rule evaluation

Control Plane:
• Offer routing, swap orchestration
• Bridge/DEX aggregator layer, risk checks

Experience Layer:
• Web/PWA, dashboards, watchlists, alerts, analytics
• Developer APIs & SDKs


INTEROPERABILITY & STANDARDS
----------------------------

• EVM: ERC-20/721/1155, ERC-3643 (permissioned), extension via adapters
• Non-EVM: SOL/SPL via adapter
• Document Anchors: IPFS/Arweave with checksum verification
• Identity/Compliance: Pluggable KYC/AML providers, allowlist proofs
• Schema versioning ensures forward compatibility


COMPLIANCE-FIRST DESIGN
-----------------------

• KYC/AML flows tailored per asset class/jurisdiction
• Rule evaluation before settlement; audit trails for issuers/regulators
• Disclosures attached to every listing; version history maintained
• Jurisdiction filters surfaced to users; transfer attempts blocked 
  if rules fail


THE MOAT
--------

• The RWA Index: Normalized, queryable dataset spanning public, 
  permissioned, and custodial domains

• Compliance Knowledge Graph: Maps token rules ↔ user eligibility; 
  grows more valuable with each integration

• Neutral, open architecture attracts issuers, wallets, aggregators

• Network effects via automated exchange proposals and bilateral matching

• AI-Driven Crawler: Continuously expands coverage and accuracy


BUSINESS MODEL
--------------

• Listing/processing fees for issuers (tiered compliance tooling)
• Take-rate on successful exchanges/swaps
• API subscriptions for data/analytics
• Enterprise integrations & white-label portals
